# Strategic Planning and Analysis

Please analyze the following topic in depth and provide a comprehensive plan, summary, and recommendations. **Important: Do not edit any code or files during this planning phase.**

## Planning Topic
{ARGUMENT}

## Analysis Instructions

### 1. Deep Analysis Phase
- Take time to thoroughly understand the current state of the codebase
- Consider the broader context and implications of the requested topic
- Identify key challenges, constraints, and opportunities
- Research best practices relevant to the topic
- Consider multiple approaches and their trade-offs

### 2. Structured Planning Output

Please provide your analysis in the following format:

#### **Current State Assessment**
- What is the current situation regarding this topic?
- What are the existing strengths and weaknesses?
- What constraints or dependencies need to be considered?

#### **Goals and Objectives**
- What are we trying to achieve?
- What would success look like?
- What are the key requirements and priorities?

#### **Proposed Approach**
- What is your recommended strategy?
- What are the key phases or steps?
- What are the main decisions that need to be made?

#### **Implementation Considerations**
- What files or components would be affected?
- What are the technical challenges or risks?
- What dependencies or prerequisites are needed?
- What testing strategies should be employed?

#### **Alternative Approaches**
- What other approaches did you consider?
- What are the pros and cons of each?
- Why did you choose your recommended approach?

#### **Next Steps**
- What should be done first?
- What is the recommended sequence of actions?
- What questions need to be answered before proceeding?

#### **Potential Risks and Mitigation**
- What could go wrong?
- How can risks be minimized?
- What contingency plans should be considered?

## Guidelines for Planning

1. **Be thorough but concise** - Provide comprehensive analysis without unnecessary detail
2. **Consider maintainability** - Think about long-term implications and code sustainability
3. **Follow Julia best practices** - Ensure recommendations align with Julia community standards
4. **Think about testing** - Consider how changes will be validated and tested
5. **Consider backwards compatibility** - Evaluate impact on existing users and APIs
6. **Resource awareness** - Consider development time and complexity
7. **Documentation impact** - Think about what documentation updates will be needed

## Important Reminders

- **NO CODE CHANGES** during this planning phase
- **NO FILE EDITS** - this is purely analytical
- **ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS** if the topic needs more specificity
- **RECOMMEND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS** but don't execute them yet
- **BE HONEST** about uncertainty or areas needing more research

After providing your plan, ask the user if they'd like to:
1. Discuss any specific aspects in more detail
2. Refine the approach based on additional considerations
3. Proceed with implementation of the recommended plan
4. Explore alternative approaches further
